<h2>Political Career</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praja_Rajyam_Party">Praja Rajyam Party</a>
<p>             Kalyan started his political career in 2008 as the president of Yuvarajyam, the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009. Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party with the Congress Party, Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Sena_Party">Janasena Party</a>
<p>             Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014. He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party. He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit.'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi). His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[70] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film commitments.</p>
